# REACT-ADS
This is the frontend for Canapads.ca.  This is a website being created to provide access to rental properties in Canada. 

Frontend is being built using ReactJS and the backend is composed of microservices written in Go and NodeJS

We also use ElasticSearch for searching, Postgres as a Database, Mongo DB for user storage, ORY Hydra as authorization server 

This is a work in progress in early stages and I am currently working in what you see in the diagram below, however more micro services will be added in the future.
